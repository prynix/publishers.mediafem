    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Publishers participating in the “Adtomatik for Sites” advertising program must comply with the policies specified below, so please read them carefully. If you fail to comply with these policies, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site or to cancel your account at any time. If your account is cancelled, you will not be eligible for participating in the program in the future.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Invalid Impressions and Clicks</strong></span></h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Publishers may not click on their own ads or use any means to inflate the number of impressions or clicks artificially, including manual methods.<br>
        Clicks on the ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on the ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, without limitation, manual clicks or impressions, and clicks and impressions generated by automated tools, robots or other deceptive software.<br>
        <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please remember that clicking on your own ads is prohibited.</span></strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Methods to Encourage Clicks</span></strong></h3>
    <p>Publishers may not ask others to click on their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks.<br>
        In order to ensure the quality of the service both for the sites as well as for the advertisers, publishers participating in the program may not:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Compensate users for viewing ads or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior.</li>
        <li>Encourage users to click on the ads using phrases such as “Click the ads”, “Support us” or other similar language.</li>
        <li>Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other advertising gimmicks.</li>
        <li>Place misleading images alongside individual ads.</li>
        <li>Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page.</li>
        <li>Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads.</li>
        <li>Place misleading labels above ads; for example, ads may be labeled “Publicity” or “Advertisements”, but not “Favorite Sites” or “Today’s Top Offers”.</li>
    </ol>
    <div><span style="font-size: small;"><br>
        </span></div>

        </span></div>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;">Copyrighted Material</span></h3>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Content Quality Guidelines</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Publishers are required to adhere to the following site content quality guidelines:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Avoid pages with duplicate content or minimum or inexistent original content.</li>
        <li>Do not include content or use any form of deceptive or manipulative behavior to improve search engine rankings.</li>
        <li>Create a useful, information-rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describe their content.</li>
    </ol>
    <div><span style="font-size: small;"><br>
        </span></div>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Traffic Sources</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources.<br>
        Ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources. For example, publishers may not participate in paid-to-click programs, send unwanted emails or display ads as the result of the action of any software application.<br>
        In order to ensure the quality of the service both for the publishers as well as for the advertisers of Adtomatik, sites displaying ads may not:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Use third-party services that generate clicks or impressions such as paid-to-click or paid-to-surf programs.</li>
        <li>Be promoted through unsolicited mass emails or unwanted advertisements on third-party websites.</li>
        <li>Be loaded by any software that can trigger pop-ups, redirect users to unwanted websites, modify browser settings or otherwise interfere with site navigation. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to direct traffic to pages that contain your ad codes.</li>
    </ol>
    <div><span style="font-size: small;"><br>
        </span></div>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ad Behavior</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Your ad codes may not be altered, nor may the standard behavior, targeting or delivery of ads be manipulated in any way.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Ad Placement</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, the ad codes may not be placed on inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software.</p>
    <p>The ad codes may not be:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Integrated into a software application of any kind, including toolbars.</li>
        <li>Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders.</li>
        <li>Placed on emails or email programs.</li>
        <li>Obscured by elements on a page.</li>
        <li>Placed on any non-content-based page.</li>
        <li>Placed on pages published specifically for the purpose of showing ads.</li>
        <li>Placed on pages whose content or URL could confuse users into thinking it is associated with Adtomatik due to the misuse of logos, registered trademarks or other brand features.</li>
    </ol>
    <div><span style="font-size: small;"><br>
        </span></div>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Site Behavior</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Sites showing ads should be easy for users to navigate. Sites may not change user preferences, redirect users to unwanted websites, initiate downloads, include malware or contain pop-ups or pop-unders that interfere with site navigation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Competitive Ads and Services</strong></span></h3>
    <p>In order to prevent user confusion, publishers may not display ads on websites that also contain other ads or services formatted to use the same layout and colors as the Adtomatik ads on that site. Although you may sell ads directly on your website, it is your responsibility to ensure that these ads cannot be confused with Adtomatik ads.</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Advertising Cookies</strong></span></h3>
    <p>Publishers must have and abide by a privacy policy that discloses that third parties may be placing and reading cookies on the users’ browsers, or using web beacons to collect information as a result of ad serving to their website.</p>
